0.18.1 (2019-01-31)
-------------------
- Breaking typo in Preview Pipeline removed 

0.18.0 (2019-01-29)
-------------------
- Calibration stacking is now separate from data reduction. Individual
  calibration frames are reduced and added to the database. The stacking 
  method then queries the database using a range of dates to determine
  which frames should be stacked. 
- It is now possible to mark frames as good or bad in the database
- Individual calibration frames for which a previous good master to 
  perform a comparison against does not exist are marked as bad

0.17.1 (2019-01-23)
-------------------
- Added a creation date column to the `CalibrationImage` table

0.17.0 (2019-01-21)
-------------------

0.16.0 (2018-12-11)
-------------------
- Significant changes made to the database structure:
  - The `PreviewImage` table has been renamed to `ProcessedImage`
  - The `Telescope` table has been renamed to `Instrument`; the `instrument` 
    column is now `camera`; and the `camera_type` column is now `type`
  - `enclosure` and `telescope` columns have been added to the `Instrument` table
  - The `BadPixelMask` table has been removed, and BPMs are now located in the 
    `CalibrationImage` table as type `BPM`
  - In the `CalibrationImage` table, `dayobs` has been changed to `dateobs` and
    provides the date and time the observation took place; `telescope_id` has 
    been renamed to `instrument_id`; an `is_master` column has been added; 
    a JSON formatted `attributes` column is now used to store parameters such 
    as `ccdsum` and `filter` which no longer have their own dedicated columns;
    and an `is_bad` column has been added to mark bad calibration frames
- To reflect the name change of the `Telescope` table to `Instrument`, all
  `telescope` instances are now named `intrument`
- All calibration frames (individual and master) are saved to the 
  `CalibrationImage` table
- The naming scheme for master calibration files has been changed from:
  ```
  {cal_type}_{instrument}_{epoch}_bin{bin}_{filter}.fits
  ```
  to:
  ```
  {site}{telescope}-{camera}-{epoch}-{cal_type}-bin{bin}-{filter}.fits
  ```
- Functionality for migrating from an old format to a new format database has
  been added to `/banzai/utils/db_migration.py`
