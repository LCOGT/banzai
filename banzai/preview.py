    Figure out if we need to try to make a preview for a given file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path: str
          Full path to the image possibly needing a preview reduction
    criteria: iterable
              A list of criterion objects that must be satisfied to produce a preview frame
    db_address: str
                SQLAlchemy style URL to the database with the status of previous preview reductions
    max_tries: int
               Maximum number of retries to make a preview image

    Returns
    -------
    need_preview: bool
                  True if we should try to make a preview reduction

    Notes
    -----
    If the file has changed on disk, we reset the success flags and the number of tries to zero.
    We only attempt to make preview images if the instrument is in the database and is set as
    schedulable.
