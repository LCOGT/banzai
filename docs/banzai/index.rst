BANZAI package
***************


This pipeline is designed to take raw data taken from Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT) Network
and produce science quality data products.


Stages
------
BANZAI is comprised of different stages, each corresponding to a single reduction step, which are chained together
to process images. The individual stages are described below, in the order that they are executed.


Overscan
========
We currently use the header the keyword ``BIASSEC`` to identify the overscan region. If this keyword is set to
"Unknown", then we simply skip subtracting the overscan. We estimate a single overscan value for the whole image
(rather than row by row).
This is saved in the header under the keyword ``BIASLVL``. If there is no overscan section, this value is derived
from the average value from the bias frames.


Crosstalk
=========
Currently, only Sinistro images are read out using multiple amplifiers. The Sinistro frames do have significant
crosstalk between amplifiers, which is removed using
linear coefficients that relate each quadrant to every other quadrant.


Gain
====
All pixels in the frame are multiplied by the gain, using the ``GAIN`` header keyword. Thus, the science
frames output by BANZAI are all in units of electrons.


Mosaic
======
Again, only the Sinistro frames currently read out with multiple amplifiers so mosaicing the amplifiers
is only required for Sinsitros.


Trim
====
After the overscan is subtracted, the bias, dark, flat-field, and science images are trimmed
based on the ``TRIMSEC`` header keyword.


Bias Subtraction
================
Full frame bias images are subtracted from each of the darks, flat field images, and science frames.
The master bias frame that was taken closest in time to the current data will be used.
This will add a few counts of noise to each pixel, but it solves two problems. First, if there is systematic
structure in the read out, this will be removed. Second, this will remove the bias values for images
that do not have an overscan region.

If no bias frame exists for this instrument, the data will not be reduced and an exception will be
raised.


Dark Subtraction
================
Full-frame master dark frames, scaled to the exposure time of the frame,
are subtracted from all flat-field and science images. The most recent
master dark frame is used. Often this is taken on the same day. If no dark frame exists for this
instrument, the data will not be reduced and an exception will be raised.


Flat Field Correction
=====================
Master flat field images (normalized to unity using the inner quarter of the image)
are divided out of every science frame. The most recent
master flat-field image for the given telescope, filter, and binning is used. If no flat field exists,
the data will not be reduced and an exception will be raised.


Source Detection
================
Source detection uses the "Source Extraction in Python" (SEP; https://github.com/kbarbary/sep).
This is similar to Source Extractor, but is written purely in Python and Cython. This allows more
customization.

We estimate the background by taking a 3x3 median filter of the image and the doing a 32x32 block
average of the image.

We use the default match filter for source detection that is provided by SEP.

We do aperture photometry using an elliptical aperture that is set by 2.5 times the Kron radius. This
produces approximately the same results as ``FLUX_AUTO`` from SExtractor.

We set the source detection limit at 3 times the global rms of the image. ``MINAREA`` is set to 5,
the default. This should minimize false detections, but may miss the faintest sources.


Astrometry
==========
The WCS is found by using Astrometry.net (Lang et al. 2012, ascl:1208.001, http://astrometry.net).
We use the catalog from the source detection (the previous step) as input.

We adopt a code tolerance of 0.003 (a factor of 3 smaller than the default), but increase the centroid
uncertainty to be 20 pixels. The large centroid uncertainty allows the algorithm to find quads even
if the initial guess is quite poor and even if there is significant distortion. However, decreasing
the code tolerance forces the algorithm to only use high quality quads, making the solution more
robust. We also go deeper into the catalogs (200 quads deep) to increase the chances of a successful
astrometry solution.

Currently no non-linear distortion is included in the WCS (the current WCS solution only has a center,
a pixel scale, and a rotation). At worst (in the image corners), the offset between
coordinates with non-linear distortion terms included and those without are ~5 arcseconds.


Master Calibration Frames
-------------------------
BANZAI also contains routines to create the master bias, dark and flat frames required for the reduction of
science frames.  Before we describe how these are created, we introduce an important statistical metric used
throughout the BANZAI pipeline.

Sigma clipping is a standard technique to reject bad pixels. However, outliers artificially increase the standard
deviation (std) of the points (which makes outliers appear to be fewer sigma away from the peak) making it difficult to
produce robust results. We have adopted a slightly different method. We use the median absolute deviation (mad) to
estimate the scatter of the distribution (traditionally characterized by the standard deviation). The mad is related to the
std by

:math:`\sigma\approx 1.4826 \times` mad

We have termed this the "robust standard deviation" (rstd). Using the robust standard deviation, we mask pixels reliably and
take a mean of the remaining pixels as usual.


Master Bias Creation
====================
For all instruments, we take many full-frame bias exposures every afternoon and morning. The afternoon and morning sets
of bias frames are typically reduced together for quality control and to increase statistics.

When creating a master bias frame for the night, we first calculate the sigma clipped mean of each image.
In this case, outliers that are 3.5 rstd from the median are rejected before calculating the mean. As
the read noise is approximately Gaussian (to surprisingly high precision), the median is a robust estimation
of the center of the pixel brightness distribution.

We then stack the individual bias frames. On a pixel by pixel basis, we reject 3 rstd outliers, and then
take the mean. This should remove and structure produced by the readout process. The noise
in each pixel should scale as sqrt(number of bias images). We take ~64 frames per night reducing the
noise per pixel to read noise (RN) / 8. Thus, only a few counts of noise are being added to the frames in quadrature.
This is much less than the ~10 electron read noise, meaning that this does not increase the noise in the science
frames in any significant way.


Master Dark Creation
====================
For all instruments, we take full-frame dark exposures every afternoon and morning. Like the bias frames,
the afternoon and morning dark frames are combined together to increase statistics. Typically, a
total of 20x300s images are taken.

When creating a master dark frame, each individual frame is scaled by the exposure time (read from the
header). The sigma clipped mean of the scaled frames is then calculated on a pixel by pixel basis.
We reject any 3 rstd outliers, similar to the master bias creation.

Our cameras have dark currents of 0.1-0.2 electrons / s per pixel. For 20x300s this corresponds to
1 - 2 electrons of additional noise per pixel added in quadrature (given the same length science frame,
and not including the Poisson noise from the dark current itself). Again, this is much smaller than the
read noise so it will not affect the noise properties of the final science frames.


Master Flat Field Creation
==========================
Twilight flats are taken every day. However, flat-field images for every filter are not taken daily,
because twilight is not long enough to take all of them. Instead the choice of filter is rotated,
based on the necessary exposure time to get a high signal to noise image and the popularity of the
filter for science programs. Typically, a master flat field is produced about once a week for any
given filter. When a flat-field image is taken for a given filter is taken in the evening twilight,
it is also taken in morning twilight for quality control. Typically, 5 flat field frames are taken
in the evening and 5 taken in the morning per filter. The frames are dithered so that we can remove
stars in the combined master flat field.

Each individual flat-field image is normalized to unity before combing them.
The normalization is calculated finding the robust sigma clipped mean (3.5 rstd outliers are rejected) of
the central region of the image. For the central region, we choose the central 25% of the field (the region
has dimensions that are half of the full image).

The flat-field frames are then stacked using a sigma clipped mean, similar to the master bias and
dark frames. We again choose to reject 3 rstd outliers.


Quality Control
---------------


Header Sanity
=============
The header sanity test first checks if any of the following principal FITS
header keywords are either missing or set to ``'N/A'``:
``RA``, ``DEC``, ``CAT-RA``, ``CAT-DEC``,
``OFST-RA``, ``OFST-DEC``, ``TPT-RA``,
``TPT-DEC``, ``PM-RA``, ``PM-DEC``,
``CRVAL1``, ``CRVAL2``, ``CRPIX1``,
``CRPIX2``, and ``EXPTIME``.

This routine then verifies that the RA value (``CRVAL1``) is between 0 and 360
and that the declination value (``CRVAL2``) is between -90 and 90.

Finally, the header checker ensures that exposure time value (``EXPTIME``) is greater than 0.
Note that this final test is not performed on bias frames, which can sometimes have negative
exposure time values.


Thousands Test
==============
There is a known issue with the Sinistro cameras where a large fraction of pixels report values of exactly 1000.
This test measures the fraction of 1000-valued pixels in each Sininstro frame, and if this fraction is above
20%, the frame is rejected.


Saturation Test
===============
A pixel is considered saturated if its values is greater than the ``SATURATE`` header kewyword.
This test measures the fraction of saturated pixels in each Sininstro frame, and if this fraction is above
5%, the frame is rejected.


Pattern Noise Detector
======================
Occasionally, if a camera is failing, it may exhibit highly structured electrical pattern noise. Although this
is not a common occurrence, it is still desirable to detect the issue as soon as possible.

This algorithm computes a power array by taking the fourier transform of the full image, then taking the median of
the absolute values along the vertical axis. Next, the SNR is computed as:

SNR = [power - median(power)] / MAD(power)

The frame is considered to have pattern noise if more than 5 bins are above an SNR of 15.

Pointing Test
=============
This test computes the offset between the requested RA and declination from the header
(given by either ``OFST-RA`` and ``OFST-DEC``, or ``CAT-RA`` and ``CAT-DEC``)
with the actual RA and declination of the observation (``CRVAL1`` and ``CRVAL2``).
The test is considered failed if the offset is above 300", and a warning is provided if it is above 30".


Master Calibration Comparison
=============================

When a calibration frame is processed by BANZAI, it can be compared to the temporally nearest
previous master to check
for significant variations, which can serve as an alert for e.g. major issues with the camera.
Since this check also discards frames found to deviate significantly,
it prevents the creation of bad master frames that can cause
problems as they are propagated through the pipeline and used for the reduction of science data.

The algorithm works as follows.  After some preprocessing that depends on the calibration type,
the SNR at each pixel is computed as:

SNR = (individual_frame - master_frame) / noise

where the noise also depends on the type of calibration.
The individual frame fails the comparison test if more than 5% of pixels have an SNR greater than 6.

The individual frame preprocessing steps and noise parameters for the different calibration types are listed below:

- bias:

  - preprocessing: bias level subtraction
  - noise = RN (read noise, from header keyword ``RDNOISE``)

- dark:

  - preprocessing: bias subtraction, normalization by exposure time
  - noise = sqrt( RN\^2 + PN\^2) / exptime, where PN is the poisson noise, computed using the
    square root of the image counts prior to normalization

- skyflat:

  - preprocessing: bias and dark subtraction, normalization by the sigma clipped mean of image
  - noise = sqrt( RN\^2 + PN\^2) / normalization


Other Considerations
--------------------


Sinistro Cameras
================
While the Spectral and SBIG cameras produce single extension fits files, the Sinistro frames produce
four amplifier outputs. In some historic data, there is a missing row in the center. This is because
the top amplifiers (3 and 4) have more light sensitive pixels than the bottom amplifiers (1 and 2).
While all of the parallel overscan rows are discarded, one edge row is discarded for the amplifiers
that have an extra light sensitive row.


Future Work
-----------


Cosmic Ray Detection
====================
Future feature: Likely will be implemented using the AstroSCRAPPY package, a variation of the
LA Cosmic algorithm (Van Dokkum, 2001, PASP, 113, 1420)


Photometric Calibration
=======================
Future Feature: Likely based on photometric calibration code by Stefano Valenti. Likely, Pan-Starrs 1
catalog will be used.
